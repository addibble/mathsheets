🧩 Product Name
RuleScope (working title)
A probabilistic behavioral analysis tool for tracking and modeling teenage rule-breaking behavior.
🎯 Purpose
RuleScope is an application designed to model and evaluate the probability of a teenager breaking predefined rules (e.g., curfew, lying, skipping class). It enables guardians or researchers to predefine behavioral hypotheses, input observational data, and receive probabilistic inferences—supporting both real-time adjudication and long-term behavioral pattern analysis.
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Users
Parents/guardians seeking structured, unbiased insight into teen behavior
Behavioral scientists or educators conducting observational studies
Developers prototyping AI-assisted behavioral prediction tools
🎯 Goals
Provide a transparent framework for defining and testing behavioral hypotheses.
Prevent post-hoc rationalization by enforcing pre-registration of hypotheses.
Support evidence-based decision-making using statistical inference (primarily Bayesian).
Visualize behavioral trends and evolving probabilities.
🔑 Key Features
1. Hypotheses Engine
Create and register behavioral hypotheses with:
Description
Conditions (e.g., context, triggers)
Prior probability estimate
Associated rule type (e.g., curfew, honesty)
Lock hypotheses to prevent post-hoc editing once data collection begins
2. Event Logging System
Add daily or incident-based observations, e.g.:
Time of arrival
Claimed location vs. verified location
Supervision status
External context (party, test, argument, etc.)
Tag events to link with specific hypotheses
3. Probability Inference Engine
Calculate posterior probabilities using Bayesian updating
Show evolving confidence in each hypothesis over time
Optional: allow manual tuning of priors or likelihood models
4. Dashboard
Visual summaries:
Hypothesis status and confidence
Recent incidents
Rule violation rates and trend lines
Decision assistant view:
“How likely is it that the teen broke curfew yesterday?”
“Which hypothesis is best supported by current evidence?”
5. Simulation & Forecasting
(Future roadmap)
Run simulations to project future probabilities under various scenarios (e.g., adding supervision, reducing access to friends)
Highlight high-risk time windows
📱 Platforms
MVP: Web application (React frontend, Python backend)
Optional CLI version for researchers
Mobile-friendly layout (future phase)
🧪 Technical Assumptions
Backend in Python with probabilistic modeling (PyMC, NumPyro, or custom Bayes logic)
Lightweight relational database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
Frontend in React or Svelte with simple charts (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts)
🚧 Constraints & Risks
Subjectivity in observations may skew model (e.g., bias in logging events)
Overconfidence in probabilistic outputs could lead to unjustified interventions
Hypotheses need to be well-calibrated to be meaningful
Privacy and ethical considerations when tracking real-world behavior
✅ Success Criteria
Users consistently define hypotheses before data entry
Inferences improve with more logged data (validated against known outcomes)
Users report better confidence in decisions through data
System can visualize trends and alert on high-risk scenarios
